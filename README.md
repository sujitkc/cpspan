This is a program that takes a list of slot. Each slot is either full (True)
or empty (False). The program computes the minimum number of moves needed
to get to a contiguous state. For example:
Trace 1: [101001] --> [011001] --> [011100] (2 steps)
Trace 2: [101001] --> [111000] (1 step).

Hence, the minimum number of steps required to achieve contiguity is 1.
